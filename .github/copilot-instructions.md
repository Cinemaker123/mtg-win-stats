## AI Coding Agent Instructions for This Codebase

### Overview
This project currently consists of a single file: `mtg.jsx`, which is empty. There are no other files, documentation, or conventions present yet.

### Immediate Guidance
- The codebase is in an initial state. There are no architectural patterns, workflows, or conventions to follow.
- If you are asked to implement features, you will need to create new files and establish project structure from scratch.
- Use modern React and JavaScript conventions when creating new components or files.
- Reference this file for initial entry point: `mtg.jsx`.

### Recommendations for AI Agents
- When starting new features, propose a sensible folder structure (e.g., `src/`, `components/`, `utils/`) and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.
- Document any new conventions or patterns in this file as the project evolves.
- If the user requests integration with external services, clarify requirements and document integration points.

### Example Initial Structure
```
mtg win stats vercel/
├── mtg.jsx
├── src/
│   └── ... (future code)
├── components/
│   └── ... (future React components)
```

### Feedback
If any section is unclear or incomplete, ask the user for clarification or additional requirements.
